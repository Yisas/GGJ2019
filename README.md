# Where The Light Shines

## Overview
[Where The Light Shines](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/where-light-shines) is a submission for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) 2019 edition, developed in 48 hours using Unity3D.

In this two-player game, a lighthouse man and a lonely sailor must collaborate to bring a lonely sailor back home to shore. The stormy harbor houses many obstacles... The game is controlled by two Xbox controllers using the left analog sticks alone. The sailor uses the stick to steer their boat and the lighthouse operation uses the stick to point the spotlight and to recharge the lighthouse light by "cranking" it back online (rotating the stick). The goal is to keep the light on the boat for the sailor to see upcoming obstacles. The sailor is fearful of the dark and without it he will panic. Single player mode is also available, but it's there as a bonus and was not the intenteded design for the game.

You may download the executable binary from the [GGJ website](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/where-light-shines). 1-2 Xbox controllers required.

## Troubleshooting
If the joysticks don't register, try plugging in the controllers after the game has been launched and is displaying the title screen.
